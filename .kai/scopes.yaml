# Define scopes for the kai tool here.
# Each scope is a set of files identified by glob patterns, used to limit
# the context sent to the AI. If this list is empty, kai defaults to
# including ALL non-ignored project files (like .gitignore).
#
# Run 'kai' and select 'Suggest Scopes' to get suggestions based on your project.
# Run 'kai' and select 'Manage Scopes' to add/edit/remove scopes interactively.
#
# Example Scope:
# - name: backend_logic
#   description: Core Node.js service files
#   include_patterns:
#     - "src/services/**/*.ts"
#     - "src/routes/**/*.ts"
#   exclude_patterns:
#     - "**/*.test.ts"
#   tags:
#     - backend
#     - node

scopes: [] # Start with an empty list. The tool defaults to 'all files' when this is empty.
