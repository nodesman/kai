# Strategic Business-to-Software Analysis ("Analysis v2.0")

**Status:** Future Exploration (Very Low Priority, Post v1.0+)
**Related:** `docs/concepts/analysis_philosophy.md`, `docs/goals/primary_objective_v1.md`

## 1. Vision & Scope

This concept explores the potential long-term evolution of Kai beyond a pure coding assistant towards a tool capable of handling high-level, ambiguous strategic goals. The core idea is to bridge the gap between a user stating a "business problem" or very vague objective and arriving at a concrete software plan or specification.

This capability would involve reasoning currently considered outside the scope of v1.0, such as:

*   Understanding underlying business needs and objectives.
*   Exploring potential platform choices (e.g., Web Application vs. Native Mobile App vs. API vs. CLI tool).
*   Suggesting or evaluating technology stack options (e.g., React vs. Vue, Node.js vs. Python backend).
*   Considering high-level architectural trade-offs.
*   Performing rudimentary cost/benefit or feasibility analysis of different solution approaches.
*   Translating strategic decisions into actionable inputs for System 1 (Requirements Clarification).

**Example Scenario:** User prompt -> "I need a way for customers to order widgets online." -> Analysis v2.0 might ask clarifying questions leading to choices like -> "Okay, we'll aim for a simple WordPress/WooCommerce site" OR "Let's plan a custom React frontend with a Node.js API."

**Relevance to Primary Goal:** This type of analysis falls into the category of "domain solving" or strategic thinking, which our discussions concluded is the work that *remains* for the human user even after Kai's S1/S2 implementation engine is perfected. Kai v1.0 focuses on *executing* well-defined specifications, not *creating* them from high-level business ambiguity.

## 2. Rationale for Deferral from v1.0

During initial planning and subsequent strategic discussions, this capability was identified but explicitly **deferred** due to several critical factors:

1.  **Focus & Core Competency (v1.0):** Kai's v1.0 identity is defined as an engine for **Maximum Personal Leverage via Reliable Implementation** (`docs/goals/primary_objective_v1.md`). The priority is mastering the S1 -> `Specification` -> S2 (TDD) loop (`docs/architecture/s1_s2_tdd_vision.md`) to reliably translate *defined* requirements into verified code. Venturing into high-level business strategy directly conflicts with this focused goal and dilutes effort on the core technical challenge.
2.  **Complexity & Ambiguity Explosion:** Handling "solve my business problem" requires reasoning far beyond code implementation. It involves product management, business analysis, market understanding, and navigating vast, ambiguous solution spaces. This is orders of magnitude more complex than the requirements clarification handled by System 1.
3.  **Software Realism (LLM Limitations):** Current LLMs, while powerful, struggle to reliably navigate extreme ambiguity and complex strategic trade-offs to produce *consistently actionable and sensible* software specifications from vague business goals. The risk of hallucination, impractical suggestions, or analysis paralysis remains very high. The required context also extends far beyond the local codebase.
4.  **User Expectation (v1.0 Target):** The primary v1.0 user (the developer aiming for personal leverage) primarily needs a tool to *execute* their designs flawlessly and rapidly. High-level strategic planning assistance is a separate (though related) need, deferred to keep the v1.0 tool focused and powerful in its core competency.
5.  **Incremental Value & Foundation:** Proving the value of the S1/S2 TDD loop provides concrete, measurable value first. This builds the necessary foundation of capability and user trust before tackling significantly more complex and ambiguous strategic tasks. Automating implementation must precede automating strategy.

## 3. Future Exploration Path (Post-v1.0)

This capability remains a potential long-term evolution for Kai, potentially forming an "S0" layer or a separate mode, as discussed in `docs/future/post_v1_options.md`. Future exploration would require:

*   **Successful v1.0:** Proven success and maturity of the core S1/S2 agentic workflows.
*   **Technological Advances:** Significant advances in LLM capabilities related to strategic reasoning, planning under ambiguity, and multi-domain knowledge integration.
*   **Strategic Alignment:** A potential future shift in Kai's strategic goals beyond purely personal implementation leverage.
*   **UX Considerations:** Careful design of how to integrate strategic dialogue without disrupting focused implementation tasks.
*   **Context Management:** Developing methods to manage the vastly increased context requirements (business goals, market info, platform details).

For now, it remains a **Very Low Priority** research item, distinct from both the core S1/S2 implementation focus and the deferred "Enhanced Code Analysis" (which focuses on deeper understanding of *existing* code).
