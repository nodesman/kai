# Strategic Business-to-Software Analysis ("Analysis v2.0")

**Status:** Future Exploration (Very Low Priority, Post v1.0+)
**Related:** `docs/concepts/analysis_philosophy.md`

## 1. Vision & Scope

This concept explores the potential long-term evolution of Kai beyond a pure coding assistant towards a tool capable of handling high-level, ambiguous strategic goals. The core idea is to bridge the gap between a user stating a "business problem" or very vague objective and arriving at a concrete software plan or specification.

This capability would involve reasoning currently considered outside the scope of v1.0, such as:

*   Understanding underlying business needs and objectives.
*   Exploring potential platform choices (e.g., Web Application vs. Native Mobile App vs. API vs. CLI tool).
*   Suggesting or evaluating technology stack options (e.g., React vs. Vue, Node.js vs. Python backend).
*   Considering high-level architectural trade-offs.
*   Performing rudimentary cost/benefit or feasibility analysis of different solution approaches.
*   Translating strategic decisions into actionable inputs for System 1 (Requirements Clarification).

**Example Scenario:** User prompt -> "I need a way for customers to order widgets online." -> Analysis v2.0 might ask clarifying questions leading to choices like -> "Okay, we'll aim for a simple WordPress/WooCommerce site" OR "Let's plan a custom React frontend with a Node.js API."

## 2. Rationale for Deferral from v1.0

During initial planning, this capability was identified but explicitly **deferred** due to several critical factors (Software Realism):

1.  **Focus & Core Competency:** Kai's v1.0 identity is an "expert AI *coding* assistant." The priority is excelling at understanding code, translating *defined* requirements into code (System 1), and assisting with implementation mechanics (System 2). Venturing into high-level business strategy is a significant domain shift that dilutes focus from mastering the core coding loop.
2.  **Complexity & Ambiguity Explosion:** Handling "solve my business problem" requires reasoning far beyond code. It touches on product management, business analysis, market understanding, and complex trade-offs with vast solution spaces. The ambiguity is orders of magnitude higher than clarifying a specific feature request.
3.  **Software Realism (LLM Limitations):** Current LLMs, while powerful, struggle to reliably navigate extreme ambiguity and strategic trade-offs to produce *consistently actionable and sensible* software specifications from vague business goals. The risk of hallucination, impractical suggestions, or analysis paralysis is very high. The required context would also extend far beyond the local codebase.
4.  **User Expectation:** It's debatable whether the primary target user (a developer) *expects* or *wants* their coding assistant to perform high-level business/product strategy. They might prefer a tool hyper-focused on executing well-defined software tasks flawlessly. Trying to be both could weaken the core value proposition.
5.  **Incremental Value:** Proving the value of Systems 1 & 2 (taking a clear software requirement and building it via TDD) provides concrete, measurable value first. This builds a necessary foundation of capability and user trust before tackling significantly more complex and ambiguous tasks.

## 3. Future Exploration Path

This capability remains a potential long-term evolution for Kai. Future exploration would require:

*   Significant maturity and proven success of the core agentic workflows (System 1 & 2).
*   Advances in LLM capabilities related to strategic reasoning, planning under ambiguity, and multi-domain knowledge integration.
*   Careful consideration of the user experience and how to effectively integrate strategic dialogue without disrupting focused coding tasks.
*   Developing methods to manage the vastly increased context requirements (business goals, market info, platform details).

For now, it remains a "Very Low" priority research item, distinct from the "Enhanced Code Analysis" which focuses on deeper understanding of the *existing* codebase.
