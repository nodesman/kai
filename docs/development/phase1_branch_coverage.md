# Phase 1: Branch Coverage Plan

This document captures the Phase 1 plan to achieve **100% branch coverage** for Kai’s core agentic TDD engine.

## Tasks

- **Run tests with coverage enabled** (`jest --coverage`).
- **Configure coverage reporters** (e.g., JSON summary, LCOV).
- **Implement parsing for the coverage report** (e.g., read JSON summary to extract branch coverage data).
- **Add logic to `AgenticTddService`** to analyze coverage after feature implementation and potentially trigger `generate_test_code` for uncovered branches.

**Dependencies:** `AgenticTddService`, `TestRunnerService`

**Priority:** Medium‑Low (Optional Enhancement)
