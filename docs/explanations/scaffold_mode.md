# Scaffold Mode

Kai can now scaffold a fresh project for you. Select **Scaffold New Project** from the main menu and provide a directory name, language, and framework. Kai creates the directory, initializes a git repository, writes default Kai configuration files, and sets up a minimal TypeScript project. After scaffolding, Kai automatically runs its startup checks in the new directory so you can immediately continue working there.
